                  "value": "<p>Health professionals, yogis, and green eating enthusiasts alike have long hailed the humble avocado for being a superstar when it comes to benefiting your health. Its benefits read like a rap sheet of antioxidants, nutrient rich vitamins and minerals, all aiding in the overall health of your skin and body. Health and Natural Beauty Guru David ’Avocado’ Wolfe has even self-named himself after the ruggedly wrapped fruit. We’ve all heard through the grapevine that fat is back and that avocados are one of the good guys but do you really know why?<br /><br />Read on to understand just how powerful this rough and sometimes misunderstood fruit really is. One can only say that its exterior is so rough so as to keep all of its luscious, mineral and vitamin rich benefits safely wrapped up just for you.<br /><br /></p>\n<h3>1. Say it with me, Fat is GOOD! Or should I say good fats are good. Let me explain...</h3>\n<p>Avocados alias as ‘Nature's Butter’ has turned it into a slightly misunderstood little fruit. Unlike vegetable fats (think canola), avocados are rich in monosaturated fats, which are great for heart health, and in aiding in the absorption of antioxidants. So <a href=\"http://blogs.webmd.com/food-and-nutrition/2013/05/avocado-surprises.html\">contrary to fatty beliefs</a>, this fat is a great one to have as part of a balanced diet, especially for those with high cholesterol or those looking to shed a couple pounds. <br /><br /></p>\n<h3>2. Rich in Nutrients &amp; Low in Sugar</h3>\n<p>These creamy little bundles are packed with protein, high in fiber (6-7grams per half fruit) and incredibly versatile! What does this mean for you? It means that swapping out that mayo, cheese or butter on your sandwich for just 1⁄2 an avocado will help fill you up for longer as well as give your<a href=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270406.php\"> brain and body the energy to power through your day</a>. <br /><br /></p>\n<h3>3. Don’t Forget The Seed!</h3>\n<p>Did you know that <a href=\"http://www.dailynutritionnews.com/avocado-seeds-super-food-for-super-health/\">70% of the antioxidants in an avocado </a>are actually in its flesh and seed?! An often overlooked part of the fruit, the antioxidants in the seed play a large part in helping to prevent heart disease and aid in the lowering of cholesterol. The seed is also great to use if trying to naturally relieve constipation or help ease diarrhea because of how rich in fiber it is.<br />Now this is not to discredit all the amazing nutrients that are packed in the flesh but if you are looking to reach optimal health and full benefits of the avocado, here are a couple ways in which you can consume the seed and all of it’s added advantages.<br /><br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>After slicing open your avocado, place the seed in a bag and hammer it down with a heavy object (olive oil bottle, rolling pin) When its broken down enough, sprinkle it in with your smoothie mix and blitz it all together. </li>\n<li>If you have a heavy -duty juicer, you can pass it through it whole along will your choice of fruit and veggies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>￼￼￼￼</p>\n<h3>￼4. Incredible Versatility</h3>\n<p>All right now, it’s time to let your culinary imagination run free! Avocados are for so much more than just your favorite guacamole recipe. With such a creamy texture and neutral taste, avocados are great to substitute into any baking recipe that calls for butter or shortening. It can be whipped up into a mousse or blitzed into a salad dressing or pasta sauce. No matter your tastes or dietary restrictions, there is a place for avocados in your meals. The new <a href=\"http://www.foodmatters.com.au/clean-eating-cooking-class-series-recipe-book\">Food Matters Recipe Book</a> has some great recipe ideas on how to incorporate this green super star on to your dinner table.<br /><br /></p>\n<h3>5. Dish Free Snacking!</h3>\n<p>If you avoid dirtying dishes like you avoid refined sugars then avocados are your new best friends! Keep it simple with a drizzle of olive oil, lemon juice, and some fresh cracked pepper. For Avo connoisseurs, work it into your breakfast by cracking an egg into the seedless side and baking it in the oven for a few minutes. Drizzle a little <a href=\"http://foodmatters.tv/content/stir-fried-veg-with-chili-ginger-chia-jam-recipe\">chili ginger chia jam</a> over top for some added zing!<br /><br /></p>\n<h3>6. Baby Health</h3>\n<p>Avocados are a rich in potassium, B vitamins, fiber as well as antioxidants. They are also rich in folate, a nutrient that <a href=\"http://researchthoughts.us/UploadedArticle/211.pdf\">promotes healthy cell and tissue development</a>, which is especially important in the development stages of pregnancy as well as infancy. Did you know that avocados also naturally boost libidos in both men and women? The Aztecs translation for an avocado tree is “ testicle tree”. So whether you’re trying or have already succeeded in getting pregnant, the benefits of avocados <a href=\"http://foodmatters.tv/articles-1/how-to-kick-start-your-sex-drive-with-libido-boosting-foods\">help you from start to finish.</a><br /><br /></p>\n<h3>7. Long- Term Health Benefits</h3>\n<p>It’s already been mentioned what a power-house of antioxidants, minerals and vitamins avocados are. One of the main antioxidants found in avocados, glutathione (say that 3 times fast) is a master at replenishing and recycling other antioxidants into the body, which helps to strengthen your immune system. <a href=\"http://researchthoughts.us/UploadedArticle/211.pdf\">Having a healthy immune system </a>gives your body the strength and ability to fight off those cancer causing free radicals as well as a host of other microbes that can lead to serious illnesses. <br /><br /></p>\n<h3>8. Avocados Love Everyone</h3>\n<p>No matter your lifestyle, there is a place for avocados in your well-balanced diet. Avocados are a great and readily available source of protein &amp; monosaturated fats for vegans and vegetarians as well as helping to keep cholesterol levels in check for the lovers of meats and cheeses. Whether you’re raw, paleo or a free range carnivore, avocados have what your body needs.<br />￼￼￼￼</p>\n<h3>9. Improve your Eye Health</h3>\n<p>Avocado contains <a href=\"http://foodmatters.tv/content/20-reasons-to-love-avocado\">81mg of the antioxidants lutein &amp; zeaxanthin</a>, which specialize in protecting your eyes from stress damage, cataracts, and macular degeneration. So mix a bit of an avocado through your rice or toss it in a salad, your eyes will thank you for it! <br /><br /></p>\n<h3>10. Radiant Skin &amp; Hair</h3>\n<p>Incredibly nourishing for your skin and quickly absorbed, avocado gets into the inner sebum layers of the skin, giving moisture to dry skin quickly and also helping to lock in that moisture. Great for people with sensitive, dry as well as oily skin. When mixed with citrus juices, the balance between the acidity in the citrus and the nourishing effects of the avocado oil help to matte the outer layer of the skin while still giving the necessary vitamins and minerals to give you that glowing complexion we’re all chasing. It’s also a good source of vitamin E, which is an antioxidant that protects against free radicals, a big benefit for both the skin and hair. Here's a<a href=\"http://www.foodmatters.tv/articles-1/make-your-own-anti-aging-face-mask\">natural face mask</a> for you to try! <br /><br />No matter how you serve it, avocado is a fruit packed with potent health benefits! </p>",

Walking is a simple and highly effective activity that can cause positive dramatic transformations in your health. Walking regularly not only reduces body fat and keeps your heart in healthy shape, but it also significantly reduces stress. The USA is a fast food eating, depressed and anxious country in general. This does not have to be the case at all. All of those negative conditions and behaviors can be improved by walking every day. </span><br /><br /><span>Simply taking a simple half hour walk after dinner every night can have profound effects on your health. It will increase circulation and cell oxygenation, aid in losing weight, and let any accumulated stress dissipate into nature. The trees will listen to you talk about your struggles if nobody else wants to. In fact, they do it better because they won't judge you or make fun of you. </span><br /><br /><span>Besides walking, here are five more subtle activities that can have amazing benefits if done daily:  </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span><strong>Gardening</strong> - even for just 20 minutes a day can be beneficial. Gardening also helps you to sustain your own homegrown, all natural foods.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Dancing</strong> to your favorite song while cleaning the house, washing dishes, or doing the laundry. It is a fun way to burn some extra calories and also work on your self-expression at the same time.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Taking the stairs </strong>instead of the elevator is priceless. You will burn calories effortlessly while lessening the environmental impact of using the elevator.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Riding a bicycle </strong>to run close errands instead of driving is my personal favorite, because it combines exercise with doing chores, while lessening my carbon footprint.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Deliberately parking farther away </strong>in a parking lot can be a lot harder than it seems. I struggle with this myself sometimes because it is so convenient to take the first empty spot. In doing this though, you are forced to walk further to get to the store, which will burn a few extra calories.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<div><span> </span></div>\n<p><span>All of the above activities (with the exception of riding bike) are pretty subtle. Please don’t be fooled by subtle movement. It is actually more sustainable to start with a little subtle movement every day than it is to go right into rigorous exercise. By listening to your body, you can eventually and gradually transition to more strenuous activities. I try to incorporate all different types of exercise into my life every day. Mixing exercise with your regular daily routine is not only easy to do, but it also makes it more fun. It gives you the opportunity to be creative and come up with your own simple workouts. </span></p>",

                  "value": "<p> </p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>We did some digging and found these 12 great reasons to eat sweet potato:</span><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>1.  Helps To Keep Disease At Bay</h2>\n<p><span>Sweet potatoes are high in Vitamin B6. A vitamin which helps to reduce the chemical homocysteine in your body. High homocysteine levels have been linked to degenerative diseases including heart attacks.</span><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>2. They Are A Good Source of Vitamin C</h2>\n<p><span>That orange color isn't just for show! These brightly colored spuds are packed with vitamin C, offering support for your immune system, bones and teeth, digestion and blood cell formation. It also helps to accelerate wound healing and improves the appearance of your skin by producing collagen.</span><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>3.  Supports Your Bones</h2>\n<p><span>It's not something we'd typically assume, but sweet potatoes contain small amounts of Vitamin D. A nutrient that helps to build healthy bones, heart, nerves, skin, and teeth, as well as support the thyroid gland. 100g of sweet potato also contains 33mg of calcium, a critical component of a healthy skeletal system!</span><br /><span><br />4.  Boosts Your Energy</span><br /><span>A source of slow-releasing carbohydrates, sweet potatoes provide us with sustained energy. But they also contain iron! You may be aware that we need the mineral iron to have adequate energy, but iron plays other important roles in our body, including red and white blood cell production, resistance to stress, proper im­mune functioning, and the metabolizing of protein, among other things.</span><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>5.  De-Stress With These Sweet Spuds</h2>\n<p><span>A good source of magnesium, sweet potatoes can help you to relax and de-stress. It's also necessary for healthy artery, blood, bone, heart, muscle, and nerve function. Yet experts estimate that approximately 80 percent of the popula­tion in North America may be deficient in this important mineral!</span><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>6.  Supports Your Heart And Kidneys</h2>\n<p><span>This tuber contains potassium, an essential electrolyte that helps to regulate your heartbeat and nerve signaling, whilst supporting healthy blood pressure. Potassium also helps to relax muscle contractions, reduce swelling, and protect and control the activity of your kidneys.</span><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>7. They Won't Spike Your Blood Sugar</h2>\n<p><span>Unlike refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta, candy and other sweets. Sweet potatoes are low on the glycemic index, slowly releasing their natural sugars into the blood stream. So you won't go on a sugar-induced rollercoaster. This helps to ensure a balanced and regular source of energy for the body, reducing fatigue during the day and excessive hunger pangs.</span><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>8. They're Loaded With Antioxidants</h2>\n<p><span>That rich orange color is a sign that they're high in carotenoids, a type of antioxidant, that are the precursors to vitamin A in your body. Vitamin A is essential for healthy eyes, a boosted immunity, and protects you against the effects of aging. They're also powerful antioxidants that help ward off cancer! </span><a href=\"http://archive.sph.harvard.edu/press-releases/archives/2000-releases/press10122000b.html\">Studies at Harvard University</a><span>of more than 124,000 people showed a 32 percent reduction in risk of lung cancer in people who consumed a variety of carotenoid-rich foods as part of their regular diet. Another study of women who had completed treatment for early-stage breast cancer conducted by researchers at Women’s Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) found that women with the highest blood concentrations of carotenoids had the least likelihood of cancer recurrence. So impressive!</span><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>9.  You Can Eat Them In Many Ways</h2>\n<p><span>They're one of the simplest foods to cook and incredibly versatile. You can roast them, puree them, steam, bake or grill them. Add them to stews, soups, salads, and even desserts! Regardless of how you have them, add a little fat/oil to get the most nutrients. </span><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>10. They're Anti-Inflammatory</h2>\n<p><span>Anthocyanin and other color-related pigments in sweet potato are equally valuable for their </span><a href=\"http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid=64\">anti-inflammatory health benefits</a><span>. </span></p>\n<div></div>\n<h2>11. They Support Healthy Wound Healing</h2>\n<p><span>The plant nutrients in </span><a href=\"http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid=64\">sweet potato impact fibrinogen</a><span> in the body. Fibrinogen is one of the key glycoproteins in the body that is required for successful blood clotting. With the help of a coagulation factor called thrombin, fibrinogen gets converted into fibrin during the blood clotting process. Balanced amounts of fibrinogen, thrombin and fibrin are a key part of the body's health and its ability to close off wounds and stop loss of blood! </span><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>12. Spuds With Anti-Bacterial Properties!</h2>\n<p><span>In sweet potatoes, researchers have long been aware of one group of resin glycosides called batatins (including batatin I and batatin II). But only recently have researchers discovered a related group of glycosides in sweet potato called batatosides (including batatodide III, batatoside IV, and batatoside V). In lab studies, most of these sweet potato glycosides have been shown to have antibacterial and antifungal properties. Cool, right?! We're excited to see what else this line of research discovers about this impressive yet humble root vegetable! </span></p>",

                  "value": "<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Made With All Natural Ingredients…Oh, Really?</strong><br /><span>The single most important thing you can start doing that will help transform your health is to read ingredient labels. I am not saying to look at the amount of calories or carbs and fat content which are stated in the nutrition facts, either. There are so many fad diet books that have brainwashed millions of people into obsessing over counting calories, eliminating carbs, and reducing fats. Although doing the aforementioned may provide some results, it is definitely not the answer for everyone.</span><br /><br /><strong>Read The Labels And Listen To Your Body!</strong><br /><span>Remember, you are unique in your own individuality, so a one size fits all diet will not be suitable to all people. Reading the actual ingredients on labels is the only way to see and know what exactly is in the food you are consuming (if it is processed). There are many toxic chemicals added to our food. Please don’t be fooled by what the front label says! Many giant food manufacturers get away with disguising chemicals as pseudo ingredients and marketing an “all natural” product, or a product “made with natural ingredients.” The laws on what is allowable on front labels for food packaging are vague at best. Just because the front says it is natural, does not always mean it truly is. Deceptive and aggravating, isn’t it?</span><br /><br /><strong>Pseudo Blanket Ingredients</strong><br /><span>Some of the lies and deception big food corporations get away with are hiding these chemicals under a blanket name. For example, what would you think if you saw the following ingredients listed: “natural flavors”, “spices” or “organic spices”? Wouldn’t you think, okay great, this really is an all-natural product? That is what I thought until I did some research into it.</span><br /><br /><strong>You Have The Right To Question Everything!</strong><br /><span>I invite you to start questioning the validity and integrity of ingredient labels. I would also recommend questioning the motives of the corporations behind the products, and who they are being manufactured by. When you start to think about it, there is no description as to what these ingredients really are. Spices? What spices? There are many times I see salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika listed as individual ingredients before “spices” is listed. Ok, so if those ingredients are not spices, then what are they? My question is: why are those four real spices individually listed and then we have an ingredient such as “spices” also listed? The same thing goes for natural flavorings. What </span>natural<span> flavorings? If the flavors are so natural then why are they not listed individually? It really makes you wonder if they are trying to hide something. There are seriously hundreds of pseudo blanket ingredients like this, but I just named a few of them.</span><br /><br /><strong>Is It Truly All Natural?</strong><br /><span>In my opinion, if a product is truly all natural, every ingredient should be listed on the ingredient label, individually. If you are not already, I would be very concerned about this; especially if you have kids. In fact, I have noticed that ingredients in children’s foods are actually worse with deceptive labeling. It is frightening, but true. I am not trying to instill fear. On the contrary, I share this information to empower you to wake up, and become aware of your food choices.</span><br /><br /><strong>Natural Flavors = Artificial Deception</strong><br /><span>One of my favorite ingredients to </span>question<span> is </span>called<span> “natural flavors.” What </span>natural<span> flavors? If it is really natural and you have nothing to hide, then why are the natural flavors not disclosed as individual ingredients on the ingredient list? Food manufacturers, including so-called natural ones, have the ability, by law, to list chemicals like MSG, trans-fat, and other non-natural chemically toxic additives as “natural flavors”. Although the natural flavor debate can be considered controversial, just remember that any food product claiming to be natural should have every single ingredient specifically listed on the ingredient list. Natural flavors is not an actual ingredient, it is a phrase that can be used to legally disguise whatever chemicals that they want.</span><br /><br /><strong>Don’t Count Calories - Count Chemicals Instead!</strong><br /><span>Did you know that there are hundreds of new chemicals introduced to our food supply each year? How about the fact that our tap water is polluted with pharmaceutical and pesticide residue? Did you know that our air is filled with noxious </span>gases<span> and heavy particulate matter every day? Well, those are just some of the chemicals that we deal with on a daily basis. Having awareness around what you are putting into your body can make a considerable difference. Synthetic ingredients such as artificial sweeteners, synthetic colorings, and MSG, can be highly toxic to the body; especially the lymphatic system. These chemicals can place a huge burden on our organs and cause health implications. Our bodies have an intuitive intelligence and know when there are foreign or toxic substances introduced. Instead of focusing on counting calories, consider counting </span>the amount of<span> chemicals in the foods you consume and the products you use instead. You can burn off calories; </span>chemicals<span>on the other hand, can remain stored in the cells and organs of your body for many years.</span><br /><br /><strong>Are you Ready to Crash the Chemical Party?</strong><br /><span>Aside from reading the actual ingredients and counting chemicals instead of calories, you are probably wondering what you can do to protect yourself from these toxins and chemicals. Well, having awareness about it (like reading this article) is the first and foremost important thing you can do. In fact, I encourage you to keep reading and researching.</span><br /><br /><br /><span>Here are some helpful tips you can keep in mind when it comes to chemicals in your food and personal care products:</span><br /><br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Just say no to GMOs! You are not Frankenstein. Make it known that you and your loved ones are not going to partake in science experiments being conducted on your body through food any longer. GMOs are not labeled, so buying certified organic is the best thing you can do to avoid GMOs.</span></li>\n<li><span>Bigger is NOT better. Hormones are another potentially dangerous addition to the food supply. Hormones are given to dairy cows so they can produce more milk. They are given to beef cattle to fatten them up, so they produce much more meat. They are also given to poultry so they grow </span>bigger,<span> and produce more eggs. Hormones, just like GMOs, are not fully tested for safety. Demand meats and dairy that is free of hormones – you have the right. This is especially important if you have children as their bodies are still growing and developing. Unfortunately, hormones are also not </span>labeled<span>, so you want to go with organic products that are certified to be hormone free.</span></li>\n<li><span>Chlorine is for disinfecting, not drinking. It is a well-known fact that chlorine is a carcinogenic substance. It is meant to disinfect water, not intended to be ingested. Even bathing in non-chlorinated water makes a difference. I have a triple stage under the sink filter to provide me with clean, safe drinking water. I also have a shower filter that removes chlorine and other toxic chemicals. My skin and hair are not as dry and I can definitely smell the difference in the water; no more “pool smell.” I highly recommend using a </span>high quality<span> drinking water and shower filter.</span></li>\n<li><span>Avoid MSG, Aspartame, and High Fructose Corn Syrup at all costs. They are all highly toxic substances which can cause damage to organs and make you addicted to junk food. When reading ingredients, make sure to look for these commonly used chemicals, and always choose to pass for a more natural option if it contains any of them.</span></li>\n</ul>",

This behaviour changed is largely caused by the chemicals used to make the dyes.</span><br /><br /><strong>A 2007 study commissioned by the British Food Standards Agency that linked a mix of food dyes, with increased levels of hyperactivity, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and lower IQs in typical/ordinary children.<br /></strong><br /><span>While those in the natural health and nutrition fields are aware of the dangers of these dyes, it appears a 2007 study in The Lancet, a reputable, mainstream medical journal, brought wider attention to this health concern.  Health Canada, the federal government health department in Canada has stated that it has begun to require the labelling of colors in food using the specific name, but that doesn’t get the toxins out of the food.  </span><br /><br /><strong>Knowing what it is doesn’t make it less dangerous, only avoidable for those who both read the label and know what to look out for.  And, I don’t see too many eight-year-olds reading labels. Not many adults do either.<br /></strong><br /><span>The food industry must be accountable for the ingredients they use and strong disincentives are needed to keep dangerous additives and artificial colors out of the food supply, particularly as many are known carcinogens.</span><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Making Safer Coloring Alternatives At Home</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://foodmatters.tv/images/organic-food-items-for-natural-food-coloring.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br /><span>Given food colors have made their way into more and more foods, you have to become a detective of sorts if you want to ensure you are avoiding them entirely! Knowing the many side effects of synthetic food colours, it makes sense to avoid them and choose safer, natural alternatives instead.</span><br /><br /><strong>By using the juices from the following foods to achieve a specific colour, will ensure you achieve a beautiful (and chemical free) end result!</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Green: </strong><span>spinach juice</span></li>\n<li><strong>Orange: </strong><span>pumpkin or carrot juice</span></li>\n<li><strong>Pink: </strong><span>rasp</span><span>berries</span><span> or beetroot</span></li>\n<li><strong>Blue: </strong><span>blueberries</span></li>\n<li><strong>Purple: </strong><span>red cabbage or grapes</span></li>\n<li><strong>Yellow: </strong><span>yellow carrots, turmeric powder, saffron flowers</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>Using natural food colours will produce more of a pastel colour than the commercially produced dyes so you may need to experiment if you seeking a very specific end result. However, the taste will be better, you won't experience allergic reactions or side effects and your body will thank you!</span></p>",

But what and how we eat can also contribute to disease. Poor nutrition is a risk factor for four of the six leading causes of death nationally - heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. Additionally, our large-scale conventional agriculture system contributes to unhealthy environments through pesticide drift, field runoff, waste burning, and diesel exhaust from transporting food long distances. The air we breathe and thousands of miles of waterways have been significantly polluted by each of these factors. We are also beginning to see alarming statistics about the impact of food systems on climate change.</strong></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span><strong><span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Projects </span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Available</span></span></strong></span></p>",

It's an inspired idea, to better understand the human diet, explore what culturally diverse families eat for a week.<strong>Their portraits feature pictures of each family with a week's worth of food purchases. We soon learn that diet is determined by largely uncontrollable forces like poverty, conflict and globalization, which can bring change with startling speed</strong>. Thus cultures can move, sometimes in a single jump, from traditional diets to the vexed plenty of global-food production. People have more to eat and, too often, eat more of nutritionally questionable food. And their health suffers. </span></p>",
